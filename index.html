				  <p>Happy 15th birthday, Piyal💝 This is the exact moment you turned 15. It's 12:00 am, 25th of May, 2024. I don't know when you are reading this message, but it was sent exactly at 12:00. Happy birthday again! 🍼
				  Dont exit, there's more ive written, wait.</p>

<p>And not only it's your birthday, but also it's a day to look back at all your memories that you had for 15 years of this life. You're 15 years old now, which is about 131400 hours, and it may vary depending on the time of your birth, which I do not know because you didn't show me your birth certificate 😡.</p>

<p>In minutes if you count, it's 7884000 minutes, and by the time you're reading this message, it's 7884001 and counting. In seconds it will be, 473040000, and it changed, again changed, and yes, again changed, haha.</p>

<p>Anyways, if you look back in time you might not remember how you were born in the hospital, hehe. You might not remember those nurses who held you in hands, you might not remember the smile on the face of your dad and mom. They are the persons in this whole world who love you the most, did you understand me 😡, doesn't matter if your boyfriend says he loves you the most, he's still on the 3rd rank 😡.</p>

<p>I'm kidding, but you don't have a boyfriend, or maybe you have idk. But do you remember those things when you were born?</p>

<p>I know you're thinking that, "how will I remember I was just a baby!" Well, you can imagine it, it's like virtual reality, but in your head. And yes, you thought it right, "you were just a baby" and still just a baby🍼.</p>

<p>I don't know whether this message is being read first or last because you have so many friends, it's okay if you are not reading it first. But let me tell you, it was sent exactly at 12:00 with the help of automation. I've started writing this message on 10th May, and I'll write daily something new and it will be sent to you all together, which is already sent and you are reading it now😉.</p>

<p>But, I forgot to tell you one thing, do you remember your first birthday celebration from your memory? I mean can you recall it? If you can then congratulations, you'll never forget it because, normally you would forget it by the age of 20-25, but here's me😎😎 I reminded you about it on your 15th birthday, so there's a small possibility of forgetting that, I hope you remember it your whole life.</p>

<p>Piyal, I had an idea to wish you exactly at 12:00 in your room, from your window if you have any. But then I realized it will be a bad idea because I don't have any knowledge about your home and I won't go online to ask you about your home. Idk you may feel that I'm really a kidnapper haha. I would literally do it if you lived near me. I would do for sure.</p>

<p>Piyal, on this special day, although it's night. Okay then. On this special night, or maybe day! Idk.. anyways, I want you to think of the names of 3 persons whom you love the most. In 10 seconds. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 You thought of them? Okay good now wait, listen to this story.</p>

<p>So, there was lived a king long time ago in Germany, his name was Nitzchergchery Géfrztexilnson 🇩🇪, and he was a good poet, he used to write stories, and poems. But wait a minute 🧐, did you just ignore his name, okay! Because you ignored his name, I'll not tell you the whole story 🤪.</p>

<p>Okay now, what I was about to say was, those three names whom you love the most. I don't care who they are because you again forgot to choose yourself in those 3 people 🥺. Why!!!🥺🥺 Love yourself, embrace yourself, Aish. You are beautiful, kind, generous, and a berry good girl.</p>

<p>I never write paragraphs, well, I used to write many years ago but not now. I'm writing it this much long because it's your birthday 😡🍼. I can write long long long paragraphs for you, but that will make things different.</p>

<p>Idk how long this message will be, but it will be interesting I guess. I may not exist next year to wish you again in the same way, or maybe a more unexpected and cooler and –98°C cool way. I have an idea. I'll not tell it to you but if I'm alive till next year, you'll see it by yourself.</p>

<p>And yes, happy birthday again and again and again 🍼. I'm happy for you. You turned 15, you gay me also gay. Your heart has beaten 315,360,000 💓 times in 15 years, and by the time you're reading this message, it has increased by a couple more hundred times📈. In those 15 years, your heart has felt different feelings, sorrow, grief, joy, regret, happiness but still working fine. Its still beating even though you faced problems, and got pain which you didn't reveal to anyone. It healed by itself. It still works. I love it, how it works 24*7 non stop.</p>

<p>I don't know how to give compliments, I just say good, and you are good. I don't know I'm your "special" or "some ordinary" friend. But I definitely know that, in my point of view, you are my friend and I have few friends, less than 5, and you are one of them and you are awesome and special.</p>

<p>Im sorry if I said anything unwanted haha. You know I'm not a mind reader but, I can assure you that you are reading this message in your mind but, in my voice.</p>

<p>I will be offline, Piyal. I have great things which are not done yet and I have to make them happen. You maybe know me as a hacker, or someone who likes technology and computers. But I learned all this during last 2-3 months. Im not stable, I don't stay at one place. There are different personalities inside me. Whatever life has to offer I'll do it. I have so many skills, in different aspects of life. I thrive to achieve more.</p>

<p>It's been 16 days since I went offline, you probably forgot about me, neither you thought about me after it crossed 10 days (maybe, I'm assuming). I thought about you and wrote this message for 16 days. Although it's not quite good enough. You probably forgot about me. But this message which you are reading right now will remind you of me. But again after some days, when I'll be inactive again, you'll forget about me and your life will go on. And that's totally fine. You must continue your life ahead.</p>

<p>I just wanted you to say that you are a good person. I'll never forget you. As I told, I've different personalities, you added one to it. "Pookie bear dinosaur", I was never like this. You were right, I'm rude. I'm rude because I don't like new people, I don't want new friends. But still idk how you became my friend. Anyways thank you.</p>

<p>You are just a baby. When you grow up, I wish you see the world as I see. Through my eyes. I will pray, for you to get the same vision. Believe me, it's great. I know you are chasmish🤪🥸 but I didn't mean that vision, I meant, another vision. Idk whether you are understanding my words or not. Just understand this much: "Happy Birthday day, Piyal, many many happy returns of the day, I'll not call you Aish anymore. Your parents named you with ample love and care, Piyal means 'LOVING'💖, I'll call you Piyal from now, If ever I come online."</p>

<p>I'm sorry, something happened to me, and let me tell you I don't hide anything. That day I told you directly that I'm so obsessed with you, it's true, I was getting obsessed with you. So obsessed. But I controlled myself and I shall distance myself from you. Don't think this is the reason for my inactivity. I thought it would be better if I distance myself from you.</p>

<p>I'm not a good person. Forgive me.</p>

<p>Happy birthday, Bye. I will miss you.</p>
